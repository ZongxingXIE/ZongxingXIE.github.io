    Made use of the echoes of UWB pulses reflected from the subject to extract phase change modulated by physiological motion (i.e., breathing and heartbeat) and estimate the heart rate and respiratory rate by spectral analysis. Leveraged depth camera to recognize ID and instant behavior as context information for long-term health data analytics.

    Developed a small type of AUV with PID algorithm to control BLDC motors to achieve hovering at the programmed depth as well as tracking the predefined paths.
    Implemented the program on STM32F103 board as Control Unit; Leveraged 3D printer to build the structure for mounting motors and control unit.
