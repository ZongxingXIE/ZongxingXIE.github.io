    Developed a cross-modal training pipeline to take Doppler-Range map and Range-Azimuth map from mmWave chip as input, 
    and use the skeletal vector extracted from Depth Camera as ground truth for instant pose recognition, 
    and sequential poses for behavior recognition. 
    (Working in process.)

    Made use of the echoes of UWB pulses reflected from the subject to 
    extract phase change modulated by physiological motion (i.e., breathing and heartbeat) 
    and estimate the heart rate and respiratory rate by spectral analysis. 
    Leveraged depth camera to recognize ID and instant behavior as context information 
    with Deep Learning models for long-term health data analytics. 
    (Under review.)

    Trained Deep Neural Network model as the feature extractor to get embeddings of the joint feature, 
    which combines acoustic and visual features collected from COTS smartphone, 
    and trained one-class SVM model for user identification/authentication.

    Developed a small type of AUV with PID algorithm to control BLDC motors to achieve hovering at the programmed depth as well as tracking the predefined paths.
    Implemented the program on STM32F103 board as Control Unit; Leveraged 3D printer to build the structure for mounting motors and control unit.
